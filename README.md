# Bayesian_Lithiation

A repository for charging simulation of amorphous SiO anode material.

This program was created for the author's environment(SIESTA).
If you download and use it, you will need to modify it to suit your environment.
Files that need to be modified:
- cal_energy.py
- poscar_to_fdf.py
- CG.py
The input files required for DFT calculations are located in /Li200/base/SIESTA/base
